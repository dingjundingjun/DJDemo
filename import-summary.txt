ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .externalToolBuilders/
* .externalToolBuilders/New_Builder (4).launch
* hs_err_pid25156.log
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt
* reboot.xml
* shut_down.xml
* shutdown_dialog.xml

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* jni/ => app/src/main/jni/
* libs/BFC_AccountManager.jar => app/libs/BFC_AccountManager.jar
* libs/BFC_Utils.jar => app/libs/BFC_Utils.jar
* libs/android-support-v4.jar => app/libs/android-support-v4.jar
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libJuheSDK_v_1_2.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libJuheSDK_v_1_2.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libhello.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libhello.so
* libs/armeabi/libJuheSDK_v_1_2.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libJuheSDK_v_1_2.so
* libs/gdt_mob_release_v4.4.479.jar => app/libs/gdt_mob_release_v4.4.479.jar
* libs/gson-2.2.2.jar => app/libs/gson-2.2.2.jar
* libs/http_ime.jar => app/libs/http_ime.jar
* libs/juhe_sdk_v_2_7.jar => app/libs/juhe_sdk_v_2_7.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
